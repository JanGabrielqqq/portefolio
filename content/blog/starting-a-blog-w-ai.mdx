I’ve been deep in AI-powered coding tools lately—jumping between Codex, GPT-4o, GPT-5.1 variants, and Claude Sonnet/Opus (Gemini 3 is still on the list). After shipping real features with them, I realized I need a place to capture what works, what doesn’t, and how these agents reshape my workflow. This blog is that place.

## Why I’m doing this
- **Track what actually works.** Shipping with AI is different from demos. Documenting helps me see which agents speed me up and where they trip.
- **Share a hands-on perspective.** Feedback from real projects beats marketing. Maybe my notes help another dev—or the people building these tools.

## How I’ll document
- **Commits as receipts.** AI-assisted changes go in their own commits, with the prompt + model version and quick notes on usefulness.
- **Session links.** When a chat agent allows sharing, I’ll link the transcript for full context.

## What to expect
- Honest takes on where AI accelerates vs. slows me down.
- Patterns for debugging with (and sometimes around) AI suggestions.
- Notes on performance, accessibility, and DX when AI writes the first draft.

## Opening note
If you're curious or an expert about AI workflows or someone building alongside AI tools or even helping create the next generation of AI agents.

…I hope this blog gives you something valuable: a fresh perspective from inside the experiment.

This is the start of a documentation journey through human-AI collaboration in software development. Let’s see where it leads.
