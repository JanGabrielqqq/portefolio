        <p>
          I'm a full-stack designer and developer passionate about creating high-performance, user-centric digital
          experiences. With over 8 years of experience, I specialize in building intuitive interfaces and robust backend
          systems using modern web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work spans across design systems, product design, and full-stack development. I believe great software is
          the intersection of beautiful design and solid engineering, where every pixel and every line of code serves a
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm working on innovative products that push the boundaries of web technology. When I'm not coding
          or designing, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source, or writing about design
          and development.
